# changelog

what shipped, session to session — newest first. this is the read-facing
counterpart to `git log`: short, dated, and about *why it matters* rather
than every commit. hosted at
[woodles.space/changelog](https://woodles.space/changelog).

read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the workspace fits
together, and `HANDOFF.md` / `REFACTORING.md` / `CONVERGENCE.md` for the
deeper narrative behind a change — this file is the index, not the story.

**the convention:** before ending a session that shipped something a reader
of the site would notice — a new route, a new feature, a real fix — add a
dated entry here. one heading per day is enough; add bullets under today's
if one already exists. skip pure internal refactors nobody outside the repo
would see, unless that refactor *was* the session. `CLAUDE.md` repeats this
so it's not easy to forget.

- **HomeSuite's first room** — `/homesuite` brings existing Write documents
  and Whiteboard boards into one recent-first index, with a shared New menu,
  navigation, title, commands, Undo/Redo, and inspector around their native
  editors. The homepage now opens this room while direct `/write` and
  `/whiteboard` links still reach the things those apps own. Collections have
  a place in the index for the next pass; no data model or presentation mode
  has been added yet.

- **cheat codes, hosted** —
  [`/marginalia/cheats`](https://woodles.space/marginalia/cheats) lists
  every code the witch's cheat console accepts, read straight from
  `CHEAT_CODES` so the page can never drift from what the console actually
  runs.
- **this system** — `/changelog` (this file), `/architecture`
  (`ARCHITECTURE.md`), and `/lore` (`LORE.md`, new) join the memorable
  addresses `/fonts`, `/write`, and `/marginalia/cheats` already use: a
  small static page per doc under `apps/changelog`, `apps/architecture`,
  and `apps/lore`, each fetching its markdown source at runtime and
  rendering it client-side with `shared/docPage.js`, so the doc and the
  page can never go out of sync.
