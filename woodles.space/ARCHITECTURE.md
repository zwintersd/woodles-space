# architecture

how the woodles.space workspace fits together, for someone working in it.

one repo, all the things, kept close. apps reach across `apps/` for each
other's code when they need to, and the shared design system sits at the same
depth so nothing is "above" anything else.

## source of truth

this file is the current source of truth for the workspace. keep it in sync when
the app inventory, shared systems, deployment shape, test/check/build behavior,
or local workflow changes.

other docs have narrower jobs:

- [README.md](./README.md) is the deployment reference.
- [REFACTORING.md](./REFACTORING.md) is the living consolidation log.
- [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) is the 10-week plan for making marginalia and
  the bestiary public-facing — all ten weeks are marked `✅ shipped` in its
  own headers, week 4 (share links, save-as-image, adopt-a-card) having
  arrived via a separate effort that merged into this branch mid-week-10;
  per-card OG unfurl images stayed the one documented stretch goal.
- [`../AUDIT.md`](../AUDIT.md) is a dated audit snapshot, not live truth.
- `apps/*/*.md` files own app-specific design briefs, proposals, assets, and
  known issues — not every app has one. doc inventory, as of week 10:
  - `apps/marginalia/`: `DESIGN.md` (mechanics, the week-6 save-discipline
    policy, and a week-10 note on what it publishes vs. only reads),
    `PROPOSAL.md`, `ASSETS.md`, `static/diorama/README.md` (the world-canvas
    art's filenames and its graceful-degradation contract), and four docs
    under `src/lib/arcade/` — `ARCADE_ROADMAP.md` (the cabinet's own polish
    log, a separate week-numbering from this file's ROADMAP.md, don't
    conflate the two), `ARCADE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (the roadmap staged
    into a build sequence), `ARCADE_REUSE.md` (what's shared across games
    vs. kept deliberately local), and `ARCADE_REVIEW.md` (an older
    resource-sharing review, now stale on the game inventory per
    `ARCADE_ROADMAP.md`'s own note about it).
  - `apps/planner/`: `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (the vitest/rune-store sharp edges
    under "the test suite" below).
  - `apps/write`, `apps/letter`, `apps/bestiary`: no doc file of their own
    — their publish/passphrase behavior is documented once, centrally, in
    "the public read path" below, rather than duplicated three times.

```

`animations/` is a Python/Manim playspace. it has no `package.json` and isn't a
member of the pnpm workspace; `vercel.json` serves its `index.html` directly.

## the two app shapes

**static apps** are one HTML file plus inline CSS and a little module JS. no
build step. `vercel.json` serves them as-is and rewrites the friendly path
(`/digits`) to the file (`/apps/digits/index.html`). they consume `shared/` at
runtime — `<link href="/shared/palette.css">` and `import … from
"/shared/library.js"`. `quiet-room` goes one step further: it pulls `three`
and its bloom post-processing addons from a CDN through a `<script
type="importmap">`, still with no build step.

**SvelteKit apps** — `write`, `marginalia`, `planner`, `notebook`, `bestiary`,
`spores`, `marginalia-devlog`, `thinking-about` — use Svelte 5 runes, Vite 7, and `@sveltejs/adapter-static`.
each builds to `apps/<name>/dist/` and consumes `shared/` through the `@shared`
Vite alias (`../../shared`). there is no SSR; every app ships as a static bundle.

`hygge` is the design playground — it holds the fonts, palette, and motifs
showcases that used to be separate pages. `/fonts`, `/palette`, and `/motifs` all
rewrite to it; `/scaffold` rewrites to `/write`. `lab` is the home for stub
experiments that should stay reachable without appearing as separate homepage
apps; it links out to `/digits` and `/animations`, whose direct routes still
work for old bookmarks.

`marginalia` is the biggest app by built size (`dist/` ~3.1 MB, week 10
perf-sanity check) — but the number that actually matters, first-load
transfer, is a much healthier ~290 KB. the difference is the reading
room's two document-import paths — `pdf.ts` (and its 1.2 MB `pdfjs-dist`
worker) and `epub.ts` — both reached only via a dynamic `await import(...)`
from `Intake.svelte`'s own file-select handlers, so neither loads until a
visitor actually opens that one feature. confirmed by measuring real
network transfer against a `vite preview` build, not just `dist/`'s total
size.

## the sync layer

a single-user sync spine that a few apps opt into. localStorage stays the source
of truth on each device; sync mirrors it to a server so the same data follows you
between machines.

**`api/sync.ts`** — a Vercel edge function over a Neon Postgres table. `GET
/api/sync?app=<name>` returns `{ blob, version }`; `POST` with `{ app, blob,
baseVersion }` is a compare-and-swap — it writes only if the version still
matches what you read, and answers `409 { conflict, server }` when the server
moved first. auth is one passphrase, sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`. the
server never stores it — only its SHA-256, compared in constant time against the
`SYNC_PASS_HASH` env var. `DATABASE_URL` comes from the Neon integration.

**`packages/sync` (`@woodles/sync`)** — the client half. `pull(app)` and
`push(app, blob, baseVersion)` wrap the endpoint; `createSyncedStore(adapter)`
owns the version bookkeeping and the "ask before clobber" decision — its
`onConflict` returns `mine`, `theirs`, or `cancel`. the passphrase lives in
memory for the session; the last-seen version is cached in localStorage.

**`apps/*/src/lib/sync.svelte.ts`** — the per-app glue. each file is ~30 lines:
a `SyncState` class with `$state` fields, its instantiation, and a call to
`createAppSync` (from `@woodles/sync`) that wires up the app-specific adapter.
the adapter's `read()` maps the store into the blob type (`PlannerBlob`,
`BestiaryBlob`, `GardenBlob`, `DevlogBlob`, `ThinkingAboutBlob`); `write()` calls
the store's `rehydrate()`; `isNewer` is optionally provided (`bestiary`,
`marginalia-devlog`, `thinking-about` use it). `marginalia` still has none of
this — it never syncs privately.
`write` gained a file in week 7, but it has no private blob to sync at all;
its adapter's `read`/`write` are no-ops, kept only to reuse `createAppSync`'s
passphrase connect/disconnect/persistence for gating the public echoes
publish below — connecting the passphrase once, in any app, connects it
everywhere, same origin, same localStorage key.

### the public read path

a second, unrelated spine, added across ROADMAP.md's weeks 1–9: publishing a
curated snapshot for anyone to read, no passphrase required. `sync` above is
what keeps Z's own data following her between devices; this is what lets a
stranger's browser see any of it at all.

**`api/public.ts`** — a second Neon-backed edge function, over its own
`published` table (`api/schema.sql`), keyed `(app, slug)`, entirely separate
from `sync`'s table.

- `GET /api/public?app=<name>&slug=<slug>` — **no auth**, and the only
  cacheable response anywhere in `api/`: `cache-control: public,
  max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400`. an unpublished slug returns
  `{ blob: null, version: 0, publishedAt: null }` with the same header — a
  200, not a 404, so a visitor's browser can always cache the answer
  either way.
- `POST` (upsert) and `DELETE` stay behind the same passphrase check as
  `sync` (`authed()`, shared from `_lib.ts`). every other response —
  `POST`/`DELETE` here, and all of `sync.ts` — stays `no-store`, the shared
  `json()` helper's default.
- republish is a whole-snapshot upsert, not a compare-and-swap: there's no
  concurrent editor racing a publish action the way `sync` has to guard
  against, so its "ask before clobber" dance doesn't apply here.
- a 4 MB cap on the POST body (week 10 hardening). the "~2-4 MB keeps the
  public GET fast" budget was a design decision from week 1's own planning
  notes, but nothing enforced it in code until now — a runaway or corrupted
  publish is rejected with `413` before it ever reaches the database,
  rather than becoming every subsequent visitor's slow unauthenticated GET.

**`packages/sync`** grows a second, parallel pair: `publish(app, slug,
blob)` and `pullPublic(app, slug)`. `pullPublic` never sends the
passphrase — its whole job is to be exactly what an unauthenticated
visitor's own fetch can see.

**the published shapes** (`packages/sync/src/publicBlobs.ts`):
`BestiaryPublicBlob` (`PublicCreature[]`) and `EchoesPublicBlob`
(`PublicLetter[]`). each publish is a curated, explicit subset of what's
stored privately — never a mirror of it. a creature publishes exactly two
assets (the rendered card image, and the isolated sprite, or the plain
upload as a fallback); a letter publishes only when its author marked it
`public: true` — filtered with `=== true`, never a truthy check, so
nothing ever leaks by accident.

**who publishes what, and who only ever reads:**

| app | publishes | reads (unauthenticated) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bestiary` | curated creatures, via `SyncPanel`'s publish section | its own gallery (`gallery.svelte.ts`) |
| `write` | letters explicitly marked `public: true` (`publish.ts`) | nothing — it's the private editor |
| `letter` | nothing (static, no editor) | the published echoes letters, for a visitor with no local copy of their own |
| `marginalia` | nothing | both: the bestiary's creatures (diorama binding, `bestiaryDb.ts`) and echoes' letters (reading room, `echoesLibrary.svelte.ts`) |

every reader degrades the same way — `idle → loading → ready/empty →
error`, never a blank crash on a slow network or a down API. `bestiary`'s
`gallery.svelte.ts` and marginalia's `echoesLibrary.svelte.ts` share that
shape on purpose; `letter/index.html`'s hand-rolled fetch (a static page,
no `@woodles/sync` import possible in the browser) and `bestiaryDb.ts`'s
IndexedDB-backed fallback chain land in the same place by different means.

## shared design tokens

the design system is shared at the lowest level only, and not by every app.

**`shared/palette.css`** defines nine themes — `cream`, `dawn`, `dusk`,
`midnight`, `forest`, `terracotta`, `inkwell`, `typewriter`, `paper` — as CSS
custom properties, switched by setting `data-theme="<id>"`. role tokens
(`--bg`, `--text`, `--accent`, `--rule`, …) carry the same meaning through every
theme, and concrete color names (`--lavender`, `--aqua`, `--peach`, `--lilac`,
`--plum`, `--lapis`, `--cream`) stay stable across them. `write` and the static
apps consume this.

the other seven SvelteKit apps don't. each ships its own token file under
`src/lib/style/tokens.css`, namespaced so it never leaks: `marginalia`
redefines the bare names under `.marginalia-root`, `planner` uses `--p-*`,
`spores` uses `--g-*`, `bestiary` uses `--b-*`, `marginalia-devlog` has its own
under `.devlog-root`, `notebook` defines `--nb-*` straight on `:root` (no
scoping class — each app is its own page, so there's nothing else in the DOM
for it to leak onto), and `thinking-about` uses `--ta-*` under
`.thinking-about-root`. `data-theme` and the nine shared themes don't reach
any of them; they own their own look.

`thinking-about`'s look is a deliberate departure even from its SvelteKit
siblings' own house style: the rest lean into a dark, serif-display,
jewel-toned "Twilight Webcore" (marginalia and spores' own tokens.css files
name it outright); `thinking-about` goes the other way on purpose — white/
near-white chrome, thin gray rules, a plain sans (`--font-sans`, already in
`shared/fonts.css`), and color living only in the entries themselves as
calendar-event-style chips. Google Calendar light-mode logic, not another
Twilight Webcore variant.

**`shared/fonts.css`** is the `--font-*` variable layer — `--font-display`,
`--font-body`, `--font-mono`, and named alternates. the `@font-face` sources are
Google Fonts, loaded per app. most apps pull this in even when they don't use the
palette.

**`shared/library.js`** is the named-things registry: `palettes`, `motifs`,
`fontPairs`, `templates`, and `find*` helpers. `write` and the static apps
(`hygge`, `letter`) read it for picker data and `?template=` loading. it is plain
JS with no types — a SvelteKit app importing from `@shared/library.js` gets
inferred structural types only, no real type safety. a `library.d.ts` sidecar
would fix that without breaking the static apps, which import the `.js` straight
in the browser.

**motifs** apply via `class="motif-<id>"` on the surface element, with the
blob/grain scaffold divs underneath — not a `data-motif` attribute. the five
motifs are `blobs`, `aurora`, `mist`, `paper`, `clean`.

## cross-app duplication

the habit: duplicate until two apps have built the same thing and converged on
its shape, then extract the shared version. premature sharing freezes an API
before the copies have stopped moving. some of these have settled; some are still
in motion. the full log is in [REFACTORING.md](./REFACTORING.md); the shape of it:

- **`sync.svelte.ts`** — consolidated. `createAppSync` in `@woodles/sync` now
  owns the passphrase lifecycle, connect/disconnect, and status tracking. each
  app's file is ~30 lines of adapter wiring. see [REFACTORING.md](./REFACTORING.md).
- **text / HTML utilities** — `sanitize`, `isEmptyHtml`, `stripTags`,
  `countWords`, `previewText`, and anchor stamping. they live in
  `write/src/lib/htmlTools.ts`, are mirrored in `marginalia/src/lib/reading/text.ts`,
  and are reimplemented inline in `letter/index.html` as a third copy. the
  contract has converged across all three; `write`'s and `marginalia`'s copies
  are tested, `letter`'s inline one isn't.
- **`EditorToolbar.svelte`** — `write` (89 lines) and `marginalia` (113).
  diverged, still moving.
- **`MarginNotes.svelte`** — `write` (204 lines) and `marginalia` (193).
  diverged, anchored to each app's own editor DOM.
- **`SelectionPopover.svelte` (write, 58 lines) / `SelectionBubble.svelte`
  (marginalia, 105)** — same idea, renamed, diverged.

the seven per-app `tokens.css` files play the same role but are deliberately
different palettes, so they aren't a consolidation target.

## the test suite

840 tests total, as of `thinking-about`'s addition: 16 in `api/` (its own
root-level `vitest.config.ts`, covering `public.ts` and `sync.ts` — the one
part of the workspace that isn't a pnpm package, so it needs its own runner
instead of the recursive `pnpm -r test`), plus 824 across seven pnpm
packages — `write` 65, `marginalia` 230, `planner` 283, `spores` 46,
`bestiary` 160, `packages/sync` 5, `thinking-about` 35. `marginalia-devlog`
has no test script. this table has already gone stale more than once — it
read 620 before weeks 1–9's own new test files, then 764 right after
week-10's own pass, then 805 once a same-week, separately-developed effort
(week 4's cards-that-travel, plus an unrelated epub reader) merged into
this branch and brought its own new tests along, then 840 once
`thinking-about` shipped. keep it updated when that happens again — it
will.

each app's `test` runs `svelte-kit sync && vitest run`. the `sync` matters: a
SvelteKit app's `tsconfig.json` extends `./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`, which
`svelte-kit sync` generates — run `vitest` without it on a fresh clone and it
can't resolve the tsconfig. because the scripts sync first, `pnpm test` works
straight from a clean checkout.

`write` and `marginalia` load the workspace-level `vitest.setup.ts` to install a
browser-like in-memory `localStorage` under Node. planner keeps its own
localStorage mock in `store.test.ts`; under the current Node runtime that suite
passes but may still print a `--localstorage-file` warning.

`planner`'s `vitest.config.ts` loads the SvelteKit plugin, and it has to:
`planner`'s store is a `.svelte.ts` module that uses `$state`, instantiated at
import time, and without the plugin compiling it vitest throws `$state is not
defined`. the apps that test rune modules either inherit the plugin from
`vite.config.ts` or don't construct a rune store at import. planner's sharp edges
are written up in [apps/planner/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./apps/planner/KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

## svelte-check

| app                 | status                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `write`             | clean                                   |
| `marginalia`        | clean                                   |
| `planner`           | clean                                   |
| `notebook`          | clean                                   |
| `bestiary`          | clean                                   |
| `spores`            | **2 errors**, 6 warnings — `GraphRenderer.svelte`/`SporeView.svelte` type errors, plus `autofocus` a11y warnings |
| `marginalia-devlog` | 1 warning — `line-clamp` in `EntryList` |
| `thinking-about`    | clean                                   |

`pnpm -r check` runs all eight in turn and reaches every one. it stops at the
first app that fails, though, so if you break an early one, run the app you care
about directly to see past it. `spores`'s 2 errors are exactly that case today
— pre-existing (last touched by an unrelated commit, well before this
roadmap's work started, confirmed via `git log`/`git diff` against every
commit in weeks 1–10), not introduced by anything in the public-facing
roadmap. left unfixed here: out of scope for a hardening pass whose job was
this roadmap's own work, not an unrelated app's stale type errors.

## running things locally

from `woodles.space/`:

```
pnpm install            one install for the whole workspace
pnpm test               api/'s own vitest, then every pnpm package with a test script (840 tests)
pnpm check              svelte-check in every app
pnpm build              build the eight SvelteKit apps
```

both `test` and `check` generate `.svelte-kit/` themselves on a fresh clone, so
order doesn't matter. to work on one app — and to step around the
stop-on-first-failure of the recursive scripts — filter to it:

```
pnpm --filter planner test
pnpm --filter planner check
pnpm --filter planner dev
```

static apps need serving (not opened as `file://`) for the `/shared/*` imports to
resolve:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000     then visit /apps/<name>/index.html
```
